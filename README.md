### 1. This is job applying site
### 2. First I created all routes of my project then checked that works or not
### 3. Then I create navbar and declare a outlet below navbar. I made 2 json data for my project as per requirements. 
### 4. Then I made banner section, job category section and job feature section. Inside job feature there is view details button . After clicking job description is shown. And we can apply for that job. If we want to apply more than one time in same job than a toast will be shown.
### 5. Then I stored job information in localStorage so that if I refresh the page data should be still there.
### 6. After that I made blogs and statistics page and made responsive only home page.
